This is a dynamic list of things I want to learn in my lifetime. I'll be frequently updating this and moving specific goal times around. These don't include things I've already learned as of writing this for the first time (2018-04-25), but if it's something I've put on this list that I've learned I'll check it off.

Chances are as I continue to update this list I'll remove or condense things. I'm just starting by copying stuff from lists online. If things require specialty tools that won't save me a lot of money in the long run, I won't plan on learning those.
