One thing I've been meaning to do recently is create and/or update what I like to call my "Life Plan". It's a concept I initially got from the Art of Manliness website, but (ironically enough), life got in the way and I haven't worked on it or done anything with it at all. Additionally, I've found some elements of it should be changed to fit my philosophy of life, especially considering my Christian worldview. In this post I'll attempt to give an overview of what a life plan is and why you'd want to make one. In following posts I'll elaborate on how to do it step by step using my own methodology.

### What is a Life Plan?
Basically, a Life Plan is a document that you create that helps you figure out what matters to you and how to best use your time. You can think of it kind of like the vision or mission statements that businesses have, but it's a little more detailed and specific to you and your life. It's something you should reference often when planning your time, and should be revised regularly as things change. Basically it gives you direction and helps you figure out "what should I do with my time"?

### Why should I make a Life Plan?
That's a good question. I've noticed, especially recently, that many things in my life lack solid structure and direction. I'm currently attending community college, but have noticed my time being spent on many other things, and sometimes I'll just be straight up bored after I finish my homework (or when I'm procrastinating it!). I think writing a Life Plan will help me better figure out what to pursue and how to do it. It's a top-down view of my time, that I can then use to detail in my weeks, days, and hours.
