This is a list of projects I've worked on.

### [Acute Care CME site](https://cme.acutecare.com)

**Tools used:** Laravel, VueJS, Bulma, Sass

I built this during my Internship at Acute Care, Inc. They needed a site where doctors could go through training to earn CME certificates. It includes an integrated admin interface used to create/edit the tests and content, and uses Imagemagick in the backend to generate certificates.

**Tools used:** Grav CMS, Bulma, Sass

I went back and forth between using a static site generator like Hugo or Jeckyll, or using a flat file CMS like Grav. I decided to go for the CMS due to the ease of editing and future extensibility.
