Hello! Welcome to my site.

I'm Jared Sackett. Ever since I got an HTML & CSS book in middle school, I've enjoyed developing websites and webapps. I like to use modern tools and frameworks such as [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), and others. Sites should be simple and lightweight (both from a user and developer perspective), but they shouldn't have to sacrifice utility and elegance in the process.

When I'm not working on websites, I spend my time playing music, volunteering at my church, tinkering with technology, reading, and working on other various hobbies. My faith is the most important thing in my life, and I try my best to live it out, although I have a long way to go. I think it's about the journey _and_ the destination.

In addition to being a showcase of projects I've done, this site is an outlet for thoughts and ideas that I want to put into writing. I believe that in order to really think about an idea, you need to talk about it, and writing is one way to do that.
