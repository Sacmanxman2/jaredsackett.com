Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Ensign Babyface! Besides, you look good in a dress. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I'll be sure to note that in my log. We have a saboteur aboard. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Computer, belay that order.
