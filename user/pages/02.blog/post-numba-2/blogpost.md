Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Let that brush dance around there and play. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Let your imagination be your guide.

You have to make those little noises or it won't work. Happy painting, God bless. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green.

I like to beat the brush. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

It is a lot of fun. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.

The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.
