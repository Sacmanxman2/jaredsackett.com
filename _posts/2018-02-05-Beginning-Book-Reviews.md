So lately, I've taken to reading a lot. I always have enjoyed reading books, but recently my interest and time spent doing it has increased significantly. Don't be concerned, I'm not an addict. Please don't call my Mom. 

Of course, being as ADHD as I am (officially actually, as of my childhood anyway), I can't just read one book, so I'm in the middle of several. Here they are, in no particular order:

- _Inception and Philosophy: Because It's Never Just a Dream_ by David Kyle Johnson
- _Dune_ by Frank Herbert
- _12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos_ by Jordan Peterson
- _Knowing God_ by J.I. Packer
- _The Bible_ by God (It might take me a while to review this one, there's a lot going on here)

No, I'm not actually going to review the Bible. Who am I to do that anyway, that's almost blasphemous just to think about.

And Here is my Master book list. All the books I want to read. It's growing quite a bit. Some of the books are novels, others are non-fiction/philosophy, and others are a bit of the educational/self-help variety. Some of the novels are classics, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and some of them are just for fun.

Some of these books are pretty hard reads. Until recently it seems, most novels had a TON of description, with lots of flowery language. I like myself a well constructed sentence, but when it's so long I have to struggle to remember the beginning of it, that's a bit much. I'm exaggerating a bit here, and since your mind is like a muscle I hope to get better at all this, but just in case for now, I will occasionally supplement my reading with SparkNotes or something similar, to make sure I don't get lost. This isn't cheating, it's using your resources, as they say.
